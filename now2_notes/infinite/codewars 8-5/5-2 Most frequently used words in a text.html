        //需求分析
        //编写一个函数，给定一串文本（可能带有标点符号和换行符），按照出现次数的降序返回前3个最常出现的单词的数组。

        //假设：
        //单词是一串字母（A到Z），可选地包含ASCII中的一个或多个撇号（'）。（不需要处理花哨的标点符号。）
        //匹配应该不区分大小写，结果中的单词应该是小写的。
        //关系可以任意打破。
        //如果文本包含少于三个唯一单词，则应返回top-2或top-1单词，如果文本不包含单词，则返回空数组。

        Write a function that, given a string of text (possibly with punctuation and line-breaks), 
        returns an array of the top-3 most occurring words, in descending order of the number of occurrences.

Assumptions:
A word is a string of letters (A to Z) optionally containing one or more apostrophes (') in ASCII. 
(No need to handle fancy punctuation.)
Matches should be case-insensitive, and the words in the result should be lowercased.
Ties may be broken arbitrarily.
If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words should be returned, 
or an empty array if a text contains no words.

Examples:
top_3_words("In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to
mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance
in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for
coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most
nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra
on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income.")
# => ["a", "of", "on"]

top_3_words("e e e e DDD ddd DdD: ddd ddd aa aA Aa, bb cc cC e e e")
# => ["e", "ddd", "aa"]

top_3_words("  //wont won't won't")
# => ["won't", "wont"]
